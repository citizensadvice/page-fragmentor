# @citizensadvice/paged

Split a HTML page into printable pages.

This is inspired by [paged.js][1].
That library is more sophisticated than our needs and was not producing consistent results across browsers.

## Instructions

Include the paged script.

The page will be chunked into printable pages.

You may set headers and footer by included `<header>` and `<footer>` elements that are children of `<body>`.
